- Generic optional arguments are quite inergonomic because the [None] variant requires a generic argument:
  F.e. `Option::<&bitcoin::EcdsaSighashType>::None`.
  This counts for all `Option<impl SomeTrait>` in arguments.
  (Sighash type is more often used optionally, maybe we can make our own type for that and not need generics?)

- Fix logging

- Should hashes arguments be references or values?
